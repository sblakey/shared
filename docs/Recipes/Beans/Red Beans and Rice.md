## Ingredients

* 1 pound (450g) red kidney beans
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil or lard
* 1 pound (about 450g) cooked andouille sausage, cut into 1/2-inch disks
* 1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 340g)
* 1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)
* 4 ribs celery, finely chopped (about 8 ounces; 225g)
* 4 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon (3 to 15g) ground cayenne pepper (depending on how hot you like it)
* 1 teaspoon (about 4g) ground sage
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 smoked ham hock (optional)
* 8 ounces (225g) pickled pork shoulder or rind (optional; see note)
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 3 bay leaves
* Hot sauce, such as Crystal or Frank's, to taste
* Cider vinegar, to taste (optional; see note)
* Cooked white rice, for serving

## Directions

1. Place beans in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups (1.5L) cold water. Add 2 tablespoons (30g) kosher salt and stir until dissolved. Set aside at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours. Drain and rinse.

2. In a large Dutch oven, heat oil or lard over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add andouille and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Season with salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened and are just starting to brown around the edges, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add cayenne pepper, sage, and a generous 10 to 12 grinds of fresh black pepper. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beans, along with enough water to cover by about 2 inches (roughly 6 to 8 cups), ham hock (if using), pickled pork (if using), thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a bare simmer. Cover and cook until beans are completely tender, **1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.** (Older beans can take longer.)

3. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has thickened and turned creamy, **about 20 minutes**. If the pot starts
 to look dry before the stew turns creamy, add a cup of water and continue simmering. Repeat as necessary until desired level of creaminess is achieved. Discard bay leaves and thyme stems. Season to taste with hot sauce, a few teaspoons of cider vinegar (if using), and more salt and pepper. *For best texture, let cool and refrigerate overnight*. Reheat the next day, adding a little water to loosen to desired consistency. Serve red beans over steamed white rice.
