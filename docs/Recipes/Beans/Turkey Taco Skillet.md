## Ingredients

- 1 cup long grain white rice TACO SEASONING 
- 1 Tbsp chili powder  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)  1/2 tsp dried oregano  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black  pepper  
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil  
- 1 lb. ground turkey  
- 1 yellow onion  
- 1 10oz. can diced tomatoes with  green chiles 
- 1 15oz. can black beans  
- 1 cup frozen corn  
- 1/2 bunch green onions 


## Instructions

1. Begin the rice first, so itâ€™s ready to go when the turkey taco  skillet is finished. Add the rice and 2 cups water to a sauce  pot. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil over high  heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let simmer  for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off and let it  rest, undisturbed, lid in place, for an additional 5 minutes.  Fluff with a fork just before serving.  
2. Combine the spices for the homemade taco seasoning,  then set the seasoning aside. 
3. Add the cooking oil and ground turkey to a large skillet.  Begin to cook the turkey over medium heat, breaking it up  into pieces as it cooks. 
4. While the turkey is cooking, dice the onion. Add the onion  to the skillet with the turkey and continue to stir and cook  until the onions are soft. Add the prepared taco seasoning,  then continue to stir and cook for 1-2 minutes more. 
5. Drain the black beans then add them to the skillet with  the diced tomatoes (with juices) and frozen corn (no need to  thaw). Stir the ingredients in the skillet to combine, then heat  through over medium. 
6. While the mixture is heating, slice the green onions. Stir the  green onions into the skillet before serving the taco mixture  over rice.
