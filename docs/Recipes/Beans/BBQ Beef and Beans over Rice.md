And BB 30-minute meal plan

## Ingredients



- 1 cup long grain white rice
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil 
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 lb. ground beef  
- 1 15oz. can kidney beans 
- 1 15oz. can black beans

### HOMEMADE BBQ SAUCE
- 8 oz. tomato sauce
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste  
- 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar  
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp molasses 
- 1/2 Tbsp Dijon mustard  
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder 
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper  
- freshly cracked pepper  
- salt to taste 

### For Serving
- 4 oz. shredded cheddar  
- 2 green onions, sliced

## Instructions
1. Begin the rice first, so it’s ready to go once the BBQ beef  and beans are finished. Add the rice and 2 cups water to a  sauce pot. Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a boil over  high heat. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let  simmer for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn the heat off  and let it rest, undisturbed, lid in place, for an additional 5  minutes. Fluff with a fork just before serving.  
2. While the rice is cooking, add the oil and minced garlic to  a large skillet. Sauté the garlic for one minute over medium  heat. Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until cooked  through. If using a higher fat content beef, drain the excess fat  before moving on to the next step. 
3. Rinse the two cans of beans, then drain them well. Add the  beans to the skillet with the ground beef. 
4. Add the ingredients for the Homemade BBQ Sauce to the  skillet (tomato sauce, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar,  brown sugar, molasses, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, smoked  paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, and some  freshly cracked pepper). 
5. Stir and cook the mixture until the sauce ingredients have  combined and created a thick sauce. Allow the sauce to come  up to a simmer and then simmer the beef and beans in the  sauce for 5 minutes, stirring often. Taste the sauce and add  salt to taste (I added 1/2 tsp). 
6. To serve the BBQ Beef and Beans, place 3/4 cup cooked rice  in each bowl, top with 1 cup of the BBQ Beef and Beans, then  top with about 1/4 cup shredded cheddar and a sprinkle of  sliced green onion.
