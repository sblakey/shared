## Ingredients

- 1 15oz. can black beans  
- 1 15oz. can black eyed peas 
- 1 bell pepper (any color)  
- 2 Roma tomatoes  
- 1 jalape単o  
- 1/4 red onion 
- 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro 

### DRESSING 
- 2 Tbsp olive oil 
- 1 fresh lime (2 Tbsp juice)  
- 1/2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar  
- 1/2 tsp chili powder  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 1/2 tsp sugar 

## Instructions
1. Rinse and drain both cans of beans in a colander. Let the  excess water drain as you prepare the vegetables. 
2. Finely dice the bell pepper, tomatoes, jalape単o, and red  onion. Try to dice the vegetables into pieces that are roughly  the same size as the beans. For a less spicy salad, scrape the  seeds out of the jalape単o before dicing. Roughly chop the  cilantro. Place the drained beans, bell pepper, tomatoes,  jalape単o, onion, and cilantro in a large bowl. 
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 2 Tbsp of juice  from the lime, balsamic vinegar, chili powder, cumin, salt,  and sugar. Pour the dressing over the salad, then stir until  everything is well coated. Serve immediately, or refrigerate  until ready to eat.
