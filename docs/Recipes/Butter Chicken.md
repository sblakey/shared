## Ingredients 

* 14oz Canned Tomatoes
* 5-6 cloves Garlic
* 1-2 tsp Minced Fresh Ginger
* 1tsp Turmeric
* 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* 1tsp Smoked Paprika
* 1tsp Kosher Salt
* 1tsp Garam Masala
* 1tsp Ground Cumin
* 1lb Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, (or use skinless chicken breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)

To finish:
* 4oz Butter cut into cubes, (use coconut oil if dairy-free)
* 4oz Heavy Cream, (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy-free)
* 1tsp Garam Masala spice mix
* 1/4-1/2c chopped cilantro

## Instant Pot instructions

1. Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better
2. Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. 
3. Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
4. Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
5. Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
6. Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
7. Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.
8. Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles
