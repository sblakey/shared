And Budget Bytes 30-minute meal plan

## Ingredients

- 1 yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 jalapeño (optional)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 15oz. cans black beans
- 1 15oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
- 1 tsp ground cumin 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika or chipotle powder
- salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Remove the stem and  seeds from the jalapeño, then dice the remaining jalapeño  flesh. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeño, and olive oil to a soup  pot and sauté over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until  the onions are soft and translucent. 
2. While the onion, garlic, and jalapeño are sautèing, use a  blender to purée two of the three cans of black beans (with  liquid from the can). If the beans are too thick to purée, add  just enough water to make them blend. 
3. Add all three cans of black beans to the soup pot (one can  of whole beans with liquid, two puréed), along with the can of  fire roasted diced tomatoes (with juices), the cumin, oregano,  and smoked paprika. Stir to combine. 
4. Place a lid on the pot and allow the soup to come up to a  simmer. Allow the soup to simmer, stirring often, for about 15  minutes. After simmering for 15 minutes, taste and add salt to  taste (I added 1/2 tsp). Serve hot with your choice of toppings.
