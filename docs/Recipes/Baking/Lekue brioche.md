2 cups (250 g) flour 
3,37 fl oz (100 ml) water 
0,3 oz (8 g) fresh yeast or 1,5 tsp (4 g) baking powder for bread 
1,5 tbsp (20 g) sugar 
2,16 fl oz (64 ml) milk 
3 tbsp (43 g) butter at room temperature 
1 egg 
1 tsp (5 g) salt

Knead all the ingredients except for the butter in the Bread Maker until you have a firm dough.Add the butter and knead again.
Leave the dough to rest for 2 hours, covered with a cloth so that it won’t dry out, and then shape into a loaf.
Beat 1 egg and brush the dough with it.  
Set aside and leave to rest for 1 hour and a half at room temperature.
Afterwards, paint the bread surface again with egg.
Once the dough is brushed with egg, preheat the oven at 356 ºF (180 ºC), make a few cuts with a pair of scissors on the bread surface and place the Bread Maker closed in the oven between 30 and 45 minutes, until the bread surface turns golden.
Finally, leave the bread to cool on a rack.
