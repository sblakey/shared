1 cup yellow cornmeal 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup sugar
4 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt
1 cup milk
1 large egg
1/4 cup cooking oil

1. Preheat the oven to 425oF and coat the inside of a 9-inch pie plate, cast iron skillet, or 8x8 casserole dish with non-stick spray (or butter for more flavor).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil.
4. Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is moist. Avoid over stirring. It's okay if there are a few lumps.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top and edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and serve.
