This ham is cooked low and slow and then coated in a sticky-sweet Cherry Coke glaze. For best results, get a good quality ham like [Benton's](http://bentonshams.com/order/index.php?cPath=21&osCsid=2a1f7362fb81d73077207ef4abb7988b).

**Note:** Before roasting your ham, you'll need to clean it and soak it. Rub it with a scrubby sponge under cool running water to remove any surface mold or salty deposits, then transfer it to a cooler and fill the cooler with cold water. Let the ham rest at room temperature in the water for at least a day, changing the water every six to eight hours. If your ham is especially well-aged, let it soak for up to two days. Country hams must be sliced very thin!

- 1 country ham, 10 to 15 pounds, soaked (see note)
- 1 liter Cherry Coke (or Dr. Pepper)
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1.  Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 250°F. Place ham fat-side up on rack set over roasting pan. Pour 2 cups water and 2 cups Coke into bottom of pan and seal tightly with aluminum foil (you may need 2 or 3 pieces). Transfer to oven and cook until ham reaches 125°F in center when tested with an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 4 hours, depending on size and shape.
    
2.  Meanwhile, combine remaining Coke, honey, brown sugar, black pepper, ground cloves, and cinnamon in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally until thick and syrupy, about 15 minutes.
    
3.  When ham has reached 125°F, remove from oven, uncover, and score fat cap in crosshatch pattern, making slices about 1-inch apart. Paint with 1/3 of glaze, increase oven temperature to 400 degrees, and bake 5 minutes. Paint with 1/3 more glaze and bake until crisp and shiny, 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven and paint with remaining glaze. Tent with foil and allow to rest 30 minutes before slicing and serving.
