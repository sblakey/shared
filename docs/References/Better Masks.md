# Better Masks

## Better-fitting "single-use" masks:
* Airpop pocket or light https://www.airpophealth.com/us/airpop-pocket-2pcs-black (40 hours of usage per mask) - reportedly good fit and seal around nose
* Actual KN95 may fit you better than KF94 https://smile.amazon.com/Safety-Filter-Efficiency%E2%89%A595-Breathable-Elastic/dp/B08Y8QNT5R

## Better-fitting reusable masks w/ replaceable filters:
* Airpop active or original (40 hours active usage per filter)
* Bilio "kangaroo" (structured to stand away from face - better antifogging) https://www.biliomask.com/
* Kitsbow masks (reportedly work well with glasses) https://www.kitsbow.com/collections/personal-protective-equipment
* Honeywell structured face mask: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KWQSTZJ

## Better-fitting washable masks:
* Bilio "koala" (structured to stand away from face - better antifogging) https://www.biliomask.com/
* Cremoly "maskup" https://www.cremoly.com/pages/our-materials
* UnderArmor Sportmask (also structured to stand away from face) https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/p/ua-sportsmask/1368010.html 


## Respirators 
*(reportedly work well with glasses, but will stand out) - seems more useful for people who need to mask all day, every day*
